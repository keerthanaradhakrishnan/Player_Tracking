# Player Re-Identification in Single Feed (Option 2)

This project implements real-time **player tracking** using a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model and the DeepSORT tracking algorithm. The goal is to assign **unique, consistent IDs** to each player in a single video feedâ€”even when players go out of frame and re-enter.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Track players in a 15-second soccer match video (`15sec_input_720p.mp4`) and re-identify them using consistent IDs, even when players temporarily disappear from the frame.
